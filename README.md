# PhotoBackup Android client
The PhotoBackup Android application is a simple service always running
silently in background and sending photos to the associated server
as soon as you take them. An upload journal allows you to see the status
of each photo in your device. It does not backup videos.

It is available on the
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.s13d.photobackup)
and on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/app/fr.s13d.photobackup).

It does not use services like Google Drive/Dropbox/SkyDrive/... **on purpose**,
as you don't know what they do with your photos. With PhotoBackup, only you should do.
