        This is the static file describing what servers preferences are.
        Each server implementation should have a string array with a name corresponding to
        the server name selected by the user. The possibilities are in the pref_server_names array.
        How they appear is defined in the server_preferences.xml file.
        The items of each array are the keys of the Preferences you do NOT want in the Fragment.
        I know it is not convenient to set those that are not in the Fragment, please make
        a pull request if you have a better solution, I don't like it much either.

        At the moment, possible items are:
            - PREF_SERVER_URL for the URL of the server ;
            - PREF_SERVER_LOGIN for the login ;
            - PREF_SERVER_PASS for the password ;
            - PREF_SERVER_BASICAUTH for the ability to handle Basic Auth, this is a preference category.

        There is not much robustness to validate if you do things right here, so do them right!
